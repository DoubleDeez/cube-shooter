Cube Shooter
============

This game was made using [Irrlicht](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/), [Irrklang](http://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/), [Bullet](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/), and [RakNet](http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/) and is subject to their licenses.

I am making this game to learn 3D game programming and networking for games.

The assets are not included in the repo but they can be downloaded here:
